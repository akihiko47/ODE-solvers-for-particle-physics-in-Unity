# üßÆ ODE solvers for particle systems üßÆ

In this repository, I have implemented some Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) solvers and cloth particle system that use them. They basically do something like this:

**X** is a vector that contains all particle's positions and velocities. The job of ODE solvers is to update this vector at every small time step. To do this they need function that returns derivative at needed moment of time.
This function can be found at `ParticleSystem` class as well as **X** vector. Simple example of how this configuration can be used in `Update()` method: `stepper.takeStep(system, Time.deltaTime);`. stepper is an instace of some 
ODE solver class and system is an instance of Particle system descendant. With positions information you can draw particles and generate meshes.

## Solvers ‚ûñ
The `ODEsolvers` file contains 3 classes. They all realize ODEsolver interface.
1) **ExplicitEuler** - high speed, low precision
2) **Trapezoidal** - medium speed, medium precision
3) **RungeKutta4** - low speed, high precision

## Installation üîß
There are 2 ways:
- import `ParticleSystems.unitypackage` via *Assets-Import* Package
- clone/download this repository and move the `Assets/Scripts/ParticleSystems` folder to your Unity project's Assets folder

## Usage ‚ûï
I've only presented two use cases: pendulum and cloth physics. But this system can be extended to:
1) **Cables**
2) **Hair**
3) **Sof-body**
4) **Liquids**
It's worth noting that computing now takes place on the CPU. For full utilization I should move the calculations to the GPU ü•¥
